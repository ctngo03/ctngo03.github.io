    <p>In the article <em>404 Page Not Found</em> by Kate Wagner, we learn about the development of the internet from the perspective of someone who quite literally grew alongside the rapid growth of the internet. One of the many points that Wagner brings up is that the newer generation&#151; my generation&#151; have developed a sort of longing for the once heavy graphic and highly saturated design of the unfledged internet. This begs the question as to why we have suddenly regressed in modernization, yearning for the chaos that included old <em>Myspace</em> pages and the net of Geocities.</p>

    <p>Although I was not present during the boom of <em>Myspace</em>, only recognizing it as just another social media platform alongside <em>Facebook</em> and <em>Tumblr</em>, Wagner talks about the extensive influence <em>Myspace</em> had on many of its users both during and after its period of fame. One of the key qualities that made <em>Myspace</em> so successful was its user customization that allowed individuals to curate their pages with colorful wallpapers and high-pixelated images. As Wagner put it, "Many former users still care about these glittery sites because they were able to make them truly their own," (Wagner). If we compared the <em>Myspace</em> of 2008 to the social media platforms we have today (e.g. <em>Facebook</em>, <em>Instagram</em>, and <em>X</em>), there is a significant decrease in the customization experience.</p>
    
<p>Let’s analyze what the current state of social media has to offer. The similarities between the social media platforms of today can be simplified down to its visual qualities: solid color background, san-serif typefaces, and minimal usage of color (aside from white, black, and logo colors). Nowadays, the only customization a user can do is adjust the information they display on their page (e.g. username or bio information). There is in fact a reason for this dramatic decrease in authenticity. Wagner states that, "Because websites had to either become apps or self-optimize for mobile, web design declined from its creative, more variegated heights to become flat, highly minimalistic, and multiplatform," (Wagner). The need for social media to be mobile friendly conquered the need for user customization. This trade-off has clearly made an impact given that our current generation’s screen-time mainly consists of endless scrolling on these social media apps.</p>
     
<p>Though we have almost been wiped clean of our social media personalization, there have been new developing platforms that have steadily brough customization back. One of these successful platforms being <em>Notion</em>, a workspace that helps users organize their ideas and projects through various methods. Notion has somewhat become a version of <em>Myspace</em> with most of the custom features but less of the social aspects. Users can organize their <em>Notion</em> page to properly serve their needs, whether it be through widgets (e.g. analogue clocks, timers, weather checker, etc.) or their advanced selection of menu types (e.g. drop-down menus, spreadsheets, bullet point lists, etc.). What’s more is that <em>Notion</em> operates both via website and mobile app so users can get the best of both worlds. It’s not hard to believe that many more platforms will follow in their lead to create dual-device platforms with both accessibility and customization in mind. </p>

<p>To conclude this response, I must quote Wagner’s quotation with their annotations of Fredrick Jameson, "The producers of culture (big name Internet companies) have nowhere to turn but to the past: the imitation of dead styles (glittergraphics, Geocities)," (Wagner). With platforms like <em>Notion</em> and <em>Tumblr</em> to prove it, we can see the steady adoption of older web styles becoming integrated into our modern web development. It is just a matter of time before we get the reinvention of <em>Myspace</em> and the customization that we all craved for decades. </p>
