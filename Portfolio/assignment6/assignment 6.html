       </header>
    
    <p>Every trend doesn't have to be for everyone but when it comes to the underwear as outerwear trend, I can't help but question who it *is* for. The only people I've seen wear the trend are ultra-thin women at various fashion weeks around the world, which immediately makes me think it's either extremely costume-y or for the rich and tiny â€” and no one else.</p>

       <h3>Would you try the trend?</h3>
       
       </header>
       <p>I will not. It took me years to be confident enough to bare my midriff out and about in broad daylight, so I won't be whipping my pants off for an outing any time soon.</p>

<h3>How do you feel about the trend?</h3>

<p>I see no harm in the trend. I think it is a fun and new way to approach the style of business casual. It also allows for the clothing to be worn in more places other than the privacy of your own home. I particularly love the way it is style over regular clothing, for instance, a lacey bra layered over a white shirt. I think it adds character to clothing that may be lacking in detail or color.</p>

<p>Definitely! I've always loved the way lingerie has a dainty and feminine feel to it. Combining its soft features with the professional/clean aspects of regular clothing makes for a brilliant contrast.</p>
