              <p>
              The world of My Neighbor Totoro takes place in the country sides of Japan where everyone owns their own acre of land and the people who live there are often farmers. This type of place is already existing, the only thing different is the Totoro aspect. In the film, there is a character by the name of Totoro who is considered the spirit of the forest. The name is elusive though the physical depiction is similar enough to real animals that I think it could be passed off to actually exist. The home of the Totoro is not as magical as some of the other mythical creatures of the Ghibli universe, in fact it is relatively normal for any animal. Totoro lives in a cove of greenery that is accessible through the base of a tree. This is similar to how squirrels or chipmunks live.

              As to who will discover this world, I decided to put some validity into it and decided on National Geographic. National Geographic is known for its wild-life observation videos where they seek to inform the general public of these animals we donâ€™t ever get to see outside of the zoo. National Geographic wants to inform people to get people to care about the world that is home to us and hundreds of animals. This is why I think they would be a perfect candidate for discovering the world of Totoro.
