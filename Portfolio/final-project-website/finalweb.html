          Here’s what you need to know about our recent nature discovery! It has come to our attention that the once believed fictional character, Totoro, is actually real. We have learned from numerous individuals of their existence after many have claimed to have seen it. People have seen it floating on tree tops, resting in grass fields, and even playing in the rain. With this knowledge, we would like to inform you of how to navigate with this information. It is crucial that you are extra careful with this information as Totoro is a spirit that can very well change the course of your life and how you will live. </p>

          <p>For starters, we must begin by stating that Totoro is a harmless being. Totoros are spiritual creatures that are deeply connected with the natural world. They thrive in spaces with greenery and plentiful walnuts for them to feed on. They live quite leisurely as they spend most of their days resting and the rest of their nights aiding the adults and children around the world. As they are deeply connected to the earth, the purpose of their very existence is to care for the earth and make sure that it is in the best condition possible. In order to facilitate that, they reward the people who make an effort to care for the nature around them. Their rewards come in many different forms, from increasing individual luck factors to helping people in tricky situations, they will be the biggest supporters.</p>

          <p>What should you do in order to be rewarded by the Totoro spirit? It’s simple. Make it a habit to help the earth as much as you can in your daily lives. These could be recycling your waste, turning off running water, pick up discarded materials, shop with reusable bags instead of plastic ones, even turning the lights off will help you. By being a friend to the earth, you are being a friend to the spirits. Totoro is a very amicable spirit and is willing to help you through any trouble but it is important to know that this is a mutual relationship that requires mutual respect. In caring for the earth, you are protecting Totoro’s home, this you will be rewarded for.
